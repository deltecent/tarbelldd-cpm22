Wrtsys.Com file explanation
---------------------------
	Wrtsys replaces SYSGEN.COM for writing or reading a double density
51 x 128 byte disk. The only time you use SYSGEN is when you are writing or
reading a single density system disk.

	Wrtsys functions the same way as SYSGEN does as far as reading or
writing a system disk. The only exception is that Wrtsys reads or writes
all 51 sectors of track 1 (system track). This allows you the ability of
expanding your bios file and add new features as you see fit.

	Wrtsys was created because of double density double sided system
disks. On a double sided system disk, track 0 is on side 0 (track 0) of the
disk, track 1 is on side 1 (track 0) of the disk. On single sided system disks,
track 0 is side 0 (track 0) and track 1 is on side 0 (track 1).

	Wrtsys does error checking to make sure you are placing an operating
system on that disk which matches the format of the disk. e.g. If you try to
put a double sided system onto a single sided disk, you will get an error
message.
